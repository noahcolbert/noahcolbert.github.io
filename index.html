        <p> I'm Noah, I was born in New Jersey but as a military brat, I've lived in many places.
            Nonetheless I consider Boston my home as I have lived here the longest and opted to stay for uni.<br>
            I am a senior computer science student. I decided to study CS because I have had a lifelong passion for computers.
            Fields I'm most interested in include low-level embedded systems programming and anything requiring C.

                    love fiction on occasion. Despite it all, my favourite book is probably The Hobbit.</p>

                    I enjoy spending unholy amounts of money on audio equipment that I end up replacing in a year. I listen to an ecclectic mix
                    of genres ranging from classical to 80s new wave to goth. </th>
